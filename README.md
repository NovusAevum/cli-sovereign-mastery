## 🎯 Mission Statement

This repository transforms command-line knowledge from scattered commands into a systematic mastery framework. Built on the **MPNS™ Methodology** (Mkdir → Position → Nano → Save), this comprehensive guide takes you from basic file operations to complete system sovereignty through terminal control.

**What makes this different:** Every command is contextualized with security implications from both red team and blue team perspectives, performance considerations for enterprise scale, real-world scenarios from Fortune 500 deployments, and cross-platform nuances for Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL). Zero fluff—only production-grade knowledge backed by 100+ professional certifications.

## ⚡ The MPNS™ Methodology

The foundation of terminal mastery lies in a repeatable, muscle-memory pattern that works across all scenarios:

```mermaid
graph LR
    M[📁 Mkdir<br/>Create Structure] --> P[🚶 Position<br/>Navigate Context]
    P --> N[✍️ Nano/Edit<br/>Craft Content]
    N --> S[💾 Save & Run<br/>Execute & Validate]
    S --> M
    
    style M fill:#667eea,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style P fill:#764ba2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style N fill:#f093fb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
    style S fill:#4facfe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
```

**Psychological Foundation:** This pattern leverages spatial memory, procedural learning, and consistent context switching to build permanent neural pathways. Military-grade repetition transforms conscious commands into unconscious reflex. After mastering MPNS™, you'll navigate terminals faster than graphical interfaces.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites Verification

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/novusaevum/cli-sovereign-mastery.git
cd cli-sovereign-mastery

# Verify your system is ready
./scripts/env-check.sh
```

### Your First MPNS™ Cycle

Execute a complete MPNS™ workflow to establish the pattern:

```bash
# M — Create project structure
mkdir -p ~/learning/first-mpns-project

# P — Position into context
cd ~/learning/first-mpns-project

# N — Create and edit file
nano hello.sh
# Paste this content:
#!/bin/bash
echo "🎖️ MPNS Protocol Activated"
echo "System: $(uname -s)"
echo "User: $(whoami)"
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"

# S — Save (CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X) and execute
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎖️ MPNS Protocol Activated
System: Darwin
User: wmh
Timestamp: Sun Oct 20 14:32:17 +08 2025
```

**Congratulations!** You've completed your first MPNS cycle. This pattern becomes reflexive through practice.

    participant User
    participant Shell
    participant Kernel
    participant FileSystem
    participant Process
    
    User->>Shell: Enter command
    Shell->>Shell: Parse & expand
    Shell->>Kernel: System call
    Kernel->>FileSystem: Check permissions
    FileSystem-->>Kernel: Access granted
    Kernel->>Process: Create/manage process
    Process->>Process: Execute binary
    Process-->>Kernel: Return exit code
    Kernel-->>Shell: Status & output
    Shell-->>User: Display result

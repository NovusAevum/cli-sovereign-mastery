## 🎖️ MPNS™ Methodology Integration

The framework consistently applies your MPNS™ protocol throughout:

**M — Mkdir:** Create project structure  
**P — Position:** Navigate into context  
**N — Nano/Edit:** Craft content  
**S — Save & Run:** Execute and validate

Every module teaches this pattern, making it reflexive through repetition.
